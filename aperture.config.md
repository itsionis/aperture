## aperture.config.ts

**Purpose:** Single source of truth for hard-coded app constants the spec says must NOT be runtime config (job cadences, JWK cap, downtime window, channel prefix, map ceilings).
**File:** `aperture.config.ts`

---

### apertureConfig
A frozen `as const` object exposed by named export. Later stages append fields here; nothing here is read from `process.env`.

Stage 0 seeds:
- `LOCATION_POLL_ONLINE_MS` — server-side location-poll cadence while a character is online (SPEC §5.3).
- `LOCATION_POLL_OFFLINE_MS` — cadence while offline.
- `JWK_REFETCH_MIN_INTERVAL_MS` — JWK-set refetch cap from SPEC §7 / footgun #3.
- `CCP_SSO_DOWNTIME_WINDOW_MIN` — minutes around 11:00 UTC tolerated as expected ESI outage.
- `MAP_EVENT_NOTIFY_CHANNEL_PREFIX` — `pg_notify` channel prefix for `ap_map_event` fanout (SPEC §5.2 / §6.5).
- `MAX_MAPS_PER_SCOPE` — legacy `pathfinder.ini` ceilings, refined in Phase 1.
- `MAX_SYSTEMS_PER_MAP` — applied where `ap_map_system.visible = true`.

Stage 2 (auth) adds:
- `SSO_AUTHORIZE_PATH` / `SSO_TOKEN_PATH` / `SSO_JWKS_PATH` — EVE SSO endpoint paths joined onto `env.AUTH_EVE_SSO_BASE` (TQ vs SISI host is env-configurable).
- `SSO_EXPECTED_ISSUER` — accepted `iss` claim values on the JWT access token (array: bare host + scheme-prefixed form).
- `SSO_TOKEN_REFRESH_BUFFER_S` — refresh the access token this many seconds before expiry (120s, matches legacy).
- `ESI_SCOPES` — default scope list requested at login; widened by later hot-path stages.

Stage 4 (ESI client) adds:
- `CCP_SSO_DOWNTIME` — CCP daily downtime start, UTC `HH:MM` (legacy `CCP_SSO_DOWNTIME`).
- `CCP_SSO_DOWNTIME_BUFFER_MIN` — extra minutes padded onto each side of the downtime window (legacy `DOWNTIME_BUFFER`).
- `ESI_BREAKER_FAILURE_THRESHOLD` — consecutive per-operationId failures that trip a breaker open.
- `ESI_BREAKER_COOLDOWN_MS` — open-breaker wait before a half-open trial request.
- `ESI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` — per-request ESI timeout (5s, matches legacy Guzzle).
- `ESI_DATASOURCE` — ESI `datasource` query param (`tranquility` vs `singularity`).

Stage 10 (paste readers & connection lifecycle) adds:
- `WORMHOLE_EOL_LIFETIME_MS` — time from EOL-stamp to reap (legacy `EXPIRE_CONNECTIONS_EOL`, 15300s / 4h15m). Read by Stage 11's EOL-expiry cron and the canvas EOL countdown.
- `WORMHOLE_DEFAULT_LIFETIME_MS` — default WH connection lifetime from creation (legacy `EXPIRE_CONNECTIONS_WH`, 172800s / 48h). Drives the "expires in X" hint before EOL is flagged, and the Stage 11 expired-wormhole cleanup cron's age cap.
- `SIGNATURE_DEFAULT_TTL_MS` — default `expires_at` offset for newly created signatures (legacy `EXPIRE_SIGNATURES`, 259200s / 5d; matches SPEC §347).

Stage 11 (graphile-worker runtime) adds:
- `JOB_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` — how many task handlers may run in parallel per worker process.
- `JOB_POLL_INTERVAL_MS` — fallback poll cadence for scheduled retries (LISTEN/NOTIFY drives the fast path).
- `JOB_INSTRUMENTATION_ERROR_MAX_LENGTH` — cap for `ap_job_run.error_text` (truncates `Error.message`).
- `JOB_INSTRUMENTATION_NOTES_MAX_BYTES` — cap for `ap_job_run.notes` (`JSON.stringify` length).
- `MAP_PURGE_GRACE_DAYS` — 30, legacy `DAYS_UNTIL_MAP_DELETION`; grace window before hard-purging soft-deleted maps at downtime.
- `JOB_DELETE_BATCH_SIZE` — per-run cap for the row-by-row cleanup jobs (bounds the pg_notify burst at downtime; leftovers picked up on the next run).
- EOL-expiry and expired-wormhole thresholds reuse the Stage 10 ms constants above (`WORMHOLE_EOL_LIFETIME_MS`, `WORMHOLE_DEFAULT_LIFETIME_MS`); the jobs convert ms → seconds at the SQL `make_interval` site so the canvas countdown and the cron threshold share one source of truth.
- Per-task cron expressions live as `cron` strings on each task module in `src/lib/jobs/tasks/`, **not** here — they are graphile-worker concerns, not cross-cutting app knobs.

### ApertureConfig
Inferred type alias for `typeof apertureConfig` so consumers don't need to import the runtime value just to type a parameter.

Stage 13 adds `INTEGRATION_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS` for read-side third-party clients and `GITHUB_CHANGELOG_REPO` for the GitHub changelog feed. Stage 17 adds `GITHUB_CHANGELOG_REVALIDATE_S` — the server-side cache lifetime (seconds) for the GitHub releases fetch.

Stage 17.8 (zKillboard live feed → underglow) adds:
- `INTEGRATION_USER_AGENT` — `User-Agent` for read-side integration requests (zKB rejects a blank UA with 403); now also used by `zkb.ts`.
- `ZKB_R2Z2_BASE` — base URL of zKillboard's R2Z2 ephemeral feed (RedisQ replacement).
- `ZKB_FEED_POLL_MS` — delay between feed sweeps; R2Z2 mandates ≥6s (hard floor).
- `ZKB_FEED_INDEX_REFRESH_MS` — how often the feed rebuilds its `solarSystemId → mapIds` index from active maps.
- `ZKB_FEED_MAX_CATCHUP` — max sequence files pulled per tick (bounds a burst; the feed is live-only, no backfill).
